Abstract

 This package produces a wide page layout for 
 documents that use A4 paper size. Moreover, 
 LayAureo provides both a simple hook for leaving 
 an empty space which is required if pages are 
 bundled by a press binding (use option 
 binding=length), and an option called big which 
 it forces typearea to become maximum. There is no 
 full English documentation yet.

Installation

 Run LaTeX on layaureo.ins and move layaureo.sty 
 into a directory searched by LaTeX. Refresh the 
 database to finish installation.
 To produce the documentation run layaureo.dtx
 through (pdf)LaTeX.
